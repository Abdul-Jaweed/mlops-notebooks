    "### Model Serving\n",
    "\n",
    "- Sharing results with others (team members, other business orgs, customers, web services, applications)\n",
    "- Batch approach: dump predictions to a database (quite popular)\n",
    "- Real-time approach: send a test feature vector and get back the prediction (the inference step happens just-in-time)\n",
    "\n",
    "### How to consume from prediction services?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Using web requests (e.g., using a JSON payload)\n",
    "\n",
    "### How to output predictions?\n",
    "\n",
    "- We will plan to set up a server to serve predictions\n",
    "  - It will respond to web requests (GET, POST)\n",
    "    - We pass some inputs (image, text, vector of numbers), and get some outputs (just like a function).\n",
    "    - The environment from which we pass inputs may be very different from the environment where the prediction happens (e.g., different hardware).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Our Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use pytorch/surpriselib with the `flask` web framework (see how to use `gunicorn` and Heroku PaaS in the exercises section) to set up a prediction server.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part 1: Making API Calls\n",
    "\n",
    "- Using the `requests` module from a jupyter notebook (this is an example of a programmatic way to get any information from other machines on the internet).\n",
    "- Alternatively, we can use commandline tools such as `curl` or commercial/GUI tools such as `postman` (these serve different needs of end users).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part 2: Simple Flask App  \n",
    "\n",
    " - Function decorators are used in Flask to achieve _routes to functions_ mapping.\n",
    " - Integrating the model with the app is relatively easy if the model can be read from disk."
