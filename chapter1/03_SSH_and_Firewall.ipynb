    "It is important to secure your connection to the remote machine. In order to do so, we will configure a secure access pattern using `ssh`, as well as set up a firewall that blocks all incoming requests except to the `ssh port 22` (and optionally, the web server ports).\n",
    "\n",
    "We will assume that we have a non-root account that is in the `sudoers` group (these are system administrators who have absolute control of everything on the machine). If not one can follow a minimal number of [steps](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-create-a-new-sudo-enabled-user-on-ubuntu-20-04-quickstart) as the root user to get such a non-root account:\n",

    " - When you first create the server instance, you may or may not have the ssh server running. If it is not running, you can install it first. On Ubuntu/Debian, you can use the following [command](https://ubuntu.com/server/docs/service-openssh):\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "sudo apt install openssh-server\n",
    "```\n",

    "#copy the content and quit (shift+colon> wq -> enter)\n",
    "chmod 600 authorized_keys\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    " - We need to ideally edit the following fields in the file `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` on the server (say using `vim`):\n",
    "   - `PermitRootLogin no` (changed from prohibit-password)\n",
    "   - `PasswordAuthentication no` (disable it for security)\n",
    "   - (Optionally) change the `Port` number to something else other than 22 (e.g., 59400)\n",

    "```bash\n",
    "sudo apt install ufw\n",
