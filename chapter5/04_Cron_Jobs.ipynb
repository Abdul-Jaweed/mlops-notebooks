    "### Cron (1975-)\n",
    "\n",
    " - As described on [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron), `cron` is a command line service/daemon/program for time based scheduling of programs (python scripts in our case). Its present in many UNIX-like OSs including Ubuntu/CentOS etc.\n",
    "\n",
    " - It is a very useful tool to automate system maintenance (e.g., taking backups) as well as for administration.\n",
    "\n",
    " - Its name originates from the greek word χρόνος (chronos) meaning time.\n",
    "\n",
    " - One of the greatest benefits of using cron is that: \n",
    "  - it has been widely used for several decades, and\n",
    "  - it is easy to use with limited ways to go wrong.\n",
    "\n",
    " - The key limitations of using a cron daemon for scheduling include:\n",
    "  - can run tasks on a single machine\n",
    "  - OS dependent\n",
    "  - need glue code (python, bash) to work with it\n",
    "\n",
    " - While cron has its issues with respect to how flexible it is in large scale production environments. But it is a great time-tested utility for individual level automation (e.g., scraping, training models repeatedly as we are planning to do etc).\n",
    "\n"

  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "\n",
    " - `crontab` is the command line utility to set up the task schedule (as a user or by root). The task (our python script) is run on the system where cron itself is present, so it is good to ensure all dependencies and logging are in place.\n",
    "\n",
    " - The tasks are run according to the privileges of the user who created the schedule.\n",
    "\n",
    " - We can edit/create a schedule by using the command `crontab -e` on the commandline (linux/macOS).\n",
    "\n",
    " - Task schedules are expressed in terms of corn expressions.\n",
    "\n",
    " - This is a sequence of 5 numbers that tell the scheduler to run your program periodically. Instead of numbers, characters such as `*`,`-`,`\\` and `,` are also used. Lets look at an example expression and understand what it does:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "1 2 3 4 5 /path/to/mycommand argument1 argument2\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    " - In the above, the first entry is the minute index (varying between 0-59), 2nd is for hour (0-23), 3rd for day of the month (1-31), 4th for month (1-12) and 5th for day of week (0 or 7 is for Sunday).\n"

    "1 2 3 4 5 username /path/to/mycommand argument1 argument2\n",
    "```\n",

    " - Example 1: To run a task everyday at 12 minutes past 2pm, our specification would be:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "12 14 * * * /path/to/mycommand argument1 argument2\n",
    "```\n",

    "```bash\n",
    "12 14 5,7 * * /path/to/mycommand argument1 argument2\n",
    "```\n",
