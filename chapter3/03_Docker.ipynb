    "> Docker is an open platform (written in Go) for developing, shipping, and running applications. \n",
    "\n",
    "> Docker enables you to separate your applications from your infrastructure so you can deliver software quickly. \n",
    "\n",
    "> With Docker, you can manage your infrastructure in the same ways you manage your applications. \n",
    "\n",
    "> By taking advantage of Dockerâ€™s methodologies for shipping, testing, and deploying code quickly, you can significantly reduce the delay between writing code and running it in production.\n",

    "### Docker Overview\n",
    "\n",
    " - A loosely isolated environment (a container) can be created using Docker.\n",
    " - We can run multiple containers on a host (like our operating system: Mac/Win/Linux)\n",
    " - Containers are light on resources compared to VMs because they run directly with the host machine's kernel.\n",
    "  - Example, you may have heard of the [linux OS kernel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_kernel).\n",
    "  - A [kernel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_(operating_system)) is a computer program at the core of a computer's operating system with complete control over everything in the system\n",

    "#### Docker Engine\n",
    "\n",
    " - Is an app that is comprised of\n",
    "  - a server (`dockerd`) that handles creating containers\n",
    "  - an API to talk to the server\n",
    "  - a CLI (`docker`) that uses the API\n",
    "\n",
    "  - The client and the daemon they interact via the API to handle creation and deployment of containers.\n",

    " - Docker registry: stores Docker images. E.g., Docker hub is a public registry.\n",
    " - Docker objects:\n",
    "  - Images\n",
    "  - Networks\n",
    "  - Containers\n",
    "  - Volumnes\n",
    "  - Plugins\n",
    " - Image: \n",
    "  - Read only template of instructions to create a container.\n",
    "  - It is often based on other images.\n",
    "  - `Dockerfile` creates images: slightly changing it does not mean rebuilding from scratch (lightweight)\n",
    "\n",
    " - When we run the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    " ```bash\n",
    "$ docker run -i -t ubuntu /bin/bash\n",
    " ```\n",
    "    - Docker pulls the image from the registry\n",
    "    - Creates a container\n",
    "    - Allocates a private filesystem\n",
    "    - Creates a network inteface\n",
    "    - Executes `/bin/bash` because of the `-i -t` flag\n",
    "\n",
    " - Services: Docker (> 1.12) has the capability to make multiple daemons work together (as a *swarm*) with load balancing automatically handled.\n",
    "\n",
    " - Container: \n",
    "    - A runnable instance of an image\n",
    "    - Several operations: create, start, stop, move, delete.\n",
    "    - When deleted, it does NOT store state!\n",
    "    - In contrast, a VM is a guest operating system that accesses host resources through a *hypervisor*.\n",

    "### Running a Container\n",
    "\n",
    " -  Download Docker for Desktop from [here](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/). You will have to create a free account with them.\n",
    "\n",
    " - Check version `docker --version`\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "![docker_hello_world](images/docker_hello_world.png)\n",
    "\n",
    " - In the above, I changed to the appropriate conda env, although it is not necessary to do so. Its just a good practice.\n",
    "\n",
    " - We can check the list of images we have locally via:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "(datasci-dev) ttmac:~ theja$ docker image ls\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
