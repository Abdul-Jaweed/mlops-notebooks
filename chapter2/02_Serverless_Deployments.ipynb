    "#### Problem\n",
    "\n",
    " - We have to take care of provisioning and server maintenance while deploying our models.\n",
    " - We have to worry about scale: would 1 server be enough?\n",
    " - How to minimize the time to deploy (at an acceptable increase in cost)?\n",
    " - How can a single developer or data science/analytics professional manage a complex service?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Solution\n",
    "\n",
    " - Software that abstracts away server details and lets you serve your model (any function actually) with few lines of code/UI. \n",
    "\n",
    " - The software automates:\n",
    "   - Provising servers\n",
    "   - Scaling machines up and down\n",
    "   - Load balancing\n",
    "   - Code versioning\n",
    "   \n",
    " - Our task is then to write our business logic and specify the requirements (e.g., pandas, pytorch)."
