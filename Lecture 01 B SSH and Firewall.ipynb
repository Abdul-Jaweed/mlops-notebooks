    "It is important to secure your connection to the machine. In order to do so, we will configure the ssh access pattern as well as set up a firewall that blocks all incoming requests except ssh port and web server ports.\n",

    "### SSH\n",
    "\n",
    " - When you first create the server instance, you may or may not have the ssh server running. If it is not running, you can install it first. On Ubuntu/Debian, you can use the following [command](https://ubuntu.com/server/docs/service-openssh):\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "sudo apt install openssh-server\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    " - Next, we create a ssh key pair on our local machine with which we will access the server. From your local user home directory:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "mkdir .ssh\n",
    "ssh-keygen\n",
    "cd .ssh\n",
    "less id_rsa.pub\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    " - Copy this content to the following file `authorized_keys` in the webserver:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "mkdir .ssh\n",
    "vim authorized_keys #if vim is not present, you can use other editors or install it using `sudo apt install vim`\n",
    "#copy the content and quit (shift+colon> wq -> enter)\n",
    "chmod 600 authorized_keys\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    " - We need to edit the following fields in the file `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` on the server (say using `vim`):\n",
    "\n",
    "   - `Port` choose something other than 22 (opttional)\n",
    "   - `PermitRootLogin no` (changed from prohibit-password)\n",
    "   - `PubkeyAuthentication yes` (already defaults to this)\n",
    "   - `PasswordAuthentication no` (disable it for security)\n",
    "\n",
    " - Restart the ssh server. In Ubuntu/Debian this is achieved by `sudo systemctl restart ssh`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Firewall\n",
    "\n",
    " - A basic firewall such as [ufw](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UFW) can help provide a layer of security.\n",
    " - Install and run it using the following commands (Ubuntu/Debian):\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "sudo apt install ufw\n",
    "sudo ufw allow [PortNumber] #here it is 22 or another port that you chose for ssh\n",
    "sudo ufw enable\n",
    "sudo ufw status verbose #this should show what the firewall is doing\n",
