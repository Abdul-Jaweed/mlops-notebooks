    "*Caveat: Unless we have a truly massive or complex system, we probably donâ€™t need Kubernetes, and using it should be the result of a deliberate cost benefit analysis in comparison to other hosted solutions or managed solutions.*\n",

    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    " - [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) is an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.\n",
    " - It was open-sourced by Google. Its predecessor was called `borg` internally.\n",
    " - Kubernetes, or K8s for short, is a central orchestration system in large complex software systems.\n",
    " - It coordinates a collection or cluster of computers with the purpose of working as a single unit. \n",
    " - When we orchestrate containers with it, we are agnostic to which computer runs which container.\n",
    " - K8s takes care of scheduling and distribution of containers to these *unnamed* computers behind the scenes.\n",
    "\n",
    " - We will primarily be interested in ML model deployment.\n",
    "\n",
    " - Lets start by going over some of the key concepts in the K8s container orchestration system below. For more information, have a look at the basics documented at [https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/kubernetes-basics/](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/kubernetes-basics/) and go from there.\n",
    "\n",
    " - A K8s cluster has two resources:\n",
    "  - Master: coordinator of the cluster\n",
    "  - Nodes: workers are essentially VMs or computers that run containers.\n",
    "\n",

    "\t<div style=\"text-align: right\"> Source: https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/kubernetes-basics/create-cluster/cluster-intro/ </div>\n",
    "\n",
    " - Each node runs `kubelet` that manages it and communicated with the master. It also runs Docker daemon (or other technologies) to manage containers.\n",
    "\n",
    " - The deploy sequence essentially involves the following:\n",
    "   - `kubectl` tells the master to start application containers.\n",
    "   - Master schedules containers to run."

    "#### Deployment\n",
    "\n",
    " - Once we have a cluster running, we can deploy containerized applications (one or many) using a *Deployment* configuration.\n",
    " - We can think of this as a set of instructions to K8s to set up the application on the cluster. Essentially, the containers are mapped to individual nodes.\n",
    " - After the mapping, a *Deployment Controller* keeps checking these instances allowing for **self-healing**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "![module_02_first_app](images/module_02_first_app.svg)\n",
    "\t<div style=\"text-align: right\"> Source: https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/kubernetes-basics/deploy-app/deploy-intro/ </div>\n",
    "\n",
    " - We create a deployment using a tool such as `kubectl` that uses an API to interact with the Master.\n",
    " - When creating a deployment, we need to specify container images as well as the number of copies of each image we want to instantiate.\n"

    "#### Nodes and Pods\n",
    "\n",
    " - When an app is deployed as a container, it is encapsulated in a pod on a specific node.\n",
    " - A pod is a collection of containers that share a few things (see below) and are typically related to each other.\n",
    " \t- Storage\n",
    " \t- Networking and IP address\n",
    " - These related containers can be a web server and a database for instance.\n",
    " - We can also have a single container in a pod (this is what we will do here).\n",
    " - Pods are the most basic unit in K8s. It is pods that are created and destroyed, not individual containers.\n",

    "\n",

    "\t<div style=\"text-align: right\"> Source: https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/kubernetes-basics/explore/explore-intro/ </div>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " - A node is essentially a VM/machine and can have multiple pods (depending on how K8s schedules pods). A node runs:\n",
    "  - Kubelet: a program that communicates between the master and the node and manages the pods on the node.\n",
    "  - Docker daemon (or equivalent) for pulling and running containers from images.\n",

    "#### Services\n",
    "\n",
    "> A Kubernetes Service is an abstraction layer which defines a logical set of Pods and enables external traffic exposure, load balancing and service discovery for those Pods.\n",
    "<div style=\"text-align: right\"> Source: https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/kubernetes-basics/expose/expose-intro/ </div>\n",
    "\n",
    " - It enables coupling between pods (each of which have a unique IP).\n",
    " - The pods with IPs cannot be typically accessed from the outside. Instead, a service can be used to allow external connections.\n",
    " - For example, a service with a *spec* that says `NodePort` exposed pods on the same port of each selected node in the cluster using NAT (Network Address Translation). We will see an example while deploying our model.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "<div style=\"text-align: right\"> Source: https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/kubernetes-basics/expose/expose-intro/ </div>\n",
    "\n",
    " - The Service abstraction lets pods get deleted and replicated in the cluster with no influence on our app.\n",
    " - A set of pods are matched to a service using labels and selectors. See [https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/kubernetes-basics/expose/expose-intro/](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/kubernetes-basics/expose/expose-intro/) for more information."
