    "## Python\n",
    "\n",
    "- We will be predominantly concerned with the Python ecosystem\n",
    "- A big advanage is that local system development can be easily moved to cloud and or a scalable on-prem solution.\n",
    "- Many companies use python to start data science projects in-house (via fresh recruits, interns etc)\n",
    "- Python has some relatively easy ways to access databases\n",
    "- Big data platforms such as Spark have great python bindings\n",
    "  - E.g., Pandas dataframe and Spark dataframe\n",
    "- Latest models (deep learning, pre-trained) are built in the python ecosystem\n",
    "- Many many useful libraries: pandas, matplotlib, flask,...\n",
    "\n",
    "### Our Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "- Learn the patterns, not the specific tools\n",
    "\n",
    "### Deployment Targets\n",
    "\n",
    "- Local machines\n",
    "- On-prem or self-hosted machines (needs DevOps skills)\n",
    "- Managed cloud\n",
    "  - Heroku (PAAS)\n",
    "  - Azure\n",
    "  - GCP\n",
    "  - AWS (IAAS)\n",
    "- The decision to deply on one versus the other depends on\n",
    "  - skills\n",
    "  - business need\n",
    "    - internal vs external\n",
    "  - scale, reliability, security\n",
    "  - costs\n",
    "  - ease of deployment\n",
    "\n",
    "### Local Deployments are Hard\n",
    "\n",
    " - Need to learn linux security\n",
    " - Need to learn how to manage access\n",
    " - Need for learn backups\n",
    " - Need to learn hot switching / reliability\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "- Also need to learn a complex ecosystem\n",
    "- Vendor lock-in (for successful businesses, this is not an issue)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Aside: Software Tools\n",
    "\n",
    "Python development can happen:\n",
    "\n",
    "- In text editors (e.g., sublime-text)\n",
    "- In IDEs (e.g., Pycharm or VSCode)\n",
    "- In Jupyter notebooks and variants (Google Colab, Databricks notebooks)\n",
    "  - vanilla notebook does not allow collaboration as such\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part 1: Setting up Jupyter access on a VPS\n",
    "\n",
    " - We will use [Vultr](https://www.vultr.com/), but all steps are vendor agnostic. Alternatives include: Digitalocean, AWS EC2, Google Cloud; using Google Colab and other vendors.\n",
    " - SSH passwordless access is set up.\n",
    " - Next, we set up a basic firewall for security.\n",
    " - This is followed by installing `conda`.\n",
    " - (Optional) To run the jupyter server uninterrupted, we will run it within a screen session.\n",
    " - We will access the server and notebooks on our local browser using SSH tunneling.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part 2: Preparing an ML Model\n",
    "\n",
    " - We will show how data is accessed, and how the model is trained (this should be familiar to you).\n",
    "   - In particular, we will look at the moive recommendation problem.\n",
    "\n",
    " - There are aspects of saving and loading models that become important in production. For instance, we would like the models to be able to live across dev/staging/prod environments. For this, we think of the notion of model persistence\n",
    "   - Natively: \n",
    "     - For example, pytorch has native [save and load methods](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/recipes/recipes/save_load_across_devices.html).\n",
    "     - Same is the case for scikit-learn and a variety of other packages.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Using MLFlow: \n",
    "     - [MLFlow](https://www.mlflow.org/docs/latest/python_api/mlflow.pytorch.html) addresses the problem of moving models across different environments without issues of incompatibility (minor version numbers, OS etc) among other things.\n",
    "     - See these links for more information: [https://pypi.org/project/mlflow/](https://pypi.org/project/mlflow/) and [mlflow.org](https://www.mlflow.org/docs/latest/models.html)\n",
