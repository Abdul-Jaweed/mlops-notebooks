    "- Special Topics in IDS (IDS 594)\n",
    "- Version: 2021-01-20\n",
    "- Term: Spring 2021\n",
    "- CRN: 44420\n",
    "- Number of Credits: 2\n",
    "- Instructor: Dr. Theja Tulabandhula\n",
    "\n",
    "This practice-oriented course surveys modern best practices around getting machine learning (ML) models into production. It continues where IDS 572 and IDS 575 left off, which is to learn multiple ways of operationalizing machine learning workflows and models in the context of the larger business end-goals. The course is complementary to IDS 561. We will gain a better understanding of strategies for model management, monitoring and deployment. We will also intertwine these topics with online experimentation techniques (A/B testing) and software engineering ideas such as version control, containerization, and continuous integration/continuous deployment.\n",
    "\n",
    "A tentative list of topics is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Deploying ML models using web servers (e.g., using Flask)\n",
    "- Containers for machine learning: the Docker ecosystem and Kubernetes\n",
    "- Model management: model tracking and logging\n",
    "- General tools such as Apache Airflow and Apache Kafka.\n",
    "- Case studies using Databricks’ MLFlow, Google’s TFX/Kubeflow, Uber’s Michelangelo, Facebook’s FBLearner Flow.\n",
    "- A/B testing of model performance and data considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Textbook\n",
    "\n",
    "- In addition to specific notes made available on Blackboard/Github, [Data Science in Production](https://leanpub.com/ProductionDataScience/) by Ben Weber (2020, $5 for the ebook/pdf) will be used. A sample of the first three chapters is available at the publishers page linked here.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Logistics\n",
    "\n",
    " - Time: Fri 6-8.30 PM\n",
    " - Location: Zoom (see Blackboard)\n",
    " - Office Hours: Zoom right after lectures (same zoom link as the lectures). \n",
    " - Communication: We will use Blackboard. You can also use email (theja@uic.edu).\n",
    " - TA: Tengteng Ma (tma24@uic.edu)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Assignments, Project and Grading\n",
    "\n",
    " - Assignments: There are no graded assignments or exams for this course.\n",
    " - Project: The objective will be to demonstrate a deployment of an existing machine learning model that you have access to. A suitable documentation of this process along with the complete set of scripts/codes/commands used is to be submitted on the due date (with no exceptions). See the [project page](Project.ipynb) for the due date and more detailed instructions.\n",
    " - Grade: Grades will be assigned based on the project (see project evaluation details on the project page on Blackboard) (80%) and course participation/attendance (20%)."
